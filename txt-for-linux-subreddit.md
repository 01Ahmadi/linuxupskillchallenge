This month-long challenge for anyone wanting to build Linux sysadmin skills is re-starting again this coming Monday.

    "Daily lessons appear in  the sub-reddit /r/linuxupskillchallenge  - which is also be used for support/discussion.  This is a 'rolling' course repeated each month. Does require some serious commitment, but if gaining/growing these skills  was one of your New Years Resolutions, then you now have no excuse! "

There was a massive surge in subscriptions last month (600!), but the it's difficult to gauge how many really committed, and how many stuck through. Any feedback very welcome.
