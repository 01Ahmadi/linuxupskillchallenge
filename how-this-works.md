#How this works

##Target audience
The first thing to say is that this course is sqaurely aimed at two groups: (1) Linux users who aspire to get Linux-related jobs in industry - junior Linux sysadmin, devops-related work and similar, and (2) Windows server admins who want to expand their knowledge to be able to work with Linux servers.

However, many others have happily used the course simply to improve their Linux command line skills – and that’s just fine too.

##Do you really need a cloud-based server?

Yes, if you’re in the target audience you definitely should. The fact that such as server is very remote, and open to attack from the whole Internet ,“makes it real”. Learning how to setup such a VPS is also a handy skill. 

Of course, you’re perfectly entitled to use a local VM, an old laptop in the corner or a Raspberry Pi instead – and all of these will work fine for the course material.

##Why Ubuntu, can I use another distro?

The notes assume Ubuntu Server LTS (18.04 or 20.04) and it would be messy to include instructions/variations for every other distro. If you use Debian or CentOS (also good server choices), you yourself will need to understand and cope with any differences (e.g. apt vs yum).

##A daily lesson
One of the key elements of the course is that the material is delivered in bite-sized lesson each day into this subreddit. At any one time, just the last four lessons are available (we remove the older ones) – this gives you a bit of an incentive to “keep up”.

Expect to spend 1-2 hours going through each. Some find it handy to read the notes through quickly in the day, then do the practical stuff in the eveneing – but do whatever suits you.
