#"Steve's Teeny Tiny Linux Server Course"

*Linux Server Administration - for Fun!*

This includes all the source material for the 20 lessons of what was the commercial online GREP101.com Linux server admin course. 

Feel free to use the course material to learn with - and if raise an "issue" if you spaot any typos or dead links.

You are free to use this under the terms of the license, but copyright remains with the author, Steve Brorens.

PS: I'd really like to make thsi available in PDF and popular eBook formats. This *should* be easy with Pandoc etc, and I'd like to have the scripts to generate these to be included here too. If this is something that you've done before, then drop me a note and I'll give you commit rights to help out.
