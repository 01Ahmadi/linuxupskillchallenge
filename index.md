# Linux Upskill Project

This course is aimed at keen beginners who aspire to get Linux-related jobs in industry - junior Linux sysadmin, devop-related work and similar. So, it's very much server focussed and commandline, but assumes essentailly no prior knowledge and starts off very gently - designed to be well-suited to a Windows or Apple person as well as those that already
using Linux in some form.

Warning: The course content somewhat "opiniated", focusses on the practical skills and  and is heavily hands-on, and very often points to curated external links. It is much less 'formal' than RHEL or Linux Foundation training.

It is however pretty intense, with a 'lesson' posted each workday of the month. This is quite a commitment, and you should budget at least 1-2 hours each day.

The subreddit will also act as a forum for participants to discuss and support each other.

If you're keen to do this, then you will also need your own Internet-exposed server; full
instructions on how to set this up for free or cheap are now up as 'DAY 0' posts in the
subreddit.

The first day's lesson will go live Monday 03 February. I won't post until I've had breakfast,
but my timezone means for most of you it will be available very early that day.
