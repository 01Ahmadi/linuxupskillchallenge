# Linux Upskill Challange

A month-long course aimed at keen beginners who aspire to get Linux-related jobs in industry - junior Linux sysadmin, devop-related work and similar. Server focussed and commandline, but assumes essentially no prior knowledge, and starts off very gently - designed to be well-suited to a Windows or Apple person as well as those that already
using Linux in some form.

The course is run via Reddit, at https://reddit.com/r/linuxupskillchallange

Each daily lesson is posted there, and it allows a great forum-style interface to discuss and get help. 

Warning: 
* Requires a daily commitment of at least 1-2 hours each day for a month
* The course content is somewhat "opinionated"
* The focus is on practical skills 
* Heavily hands-on
* Often points to curated external links. 
* Is much less 'formal' than RHEL or Linux Foundation training.

But is fully open source, Free - and costs you nothing but your time! 

The subreddit will also act as a forum for participants to discuss and support each other.

If you're keen to do this, then you will need your own Internet-exposed server - but full
instructions on how to set this up for free or cheap are now up as 'DAY 0' posts in the
subreddit.

The first day's lesson will go live Monday 03 February. I won't post until I've had breakfast,
but my timezone means for most of you it will be available very early that day. As the next few day's lesson go up, we'll be trimming off the earlier ones - so don't procrastinate!

Each month we'll 'reset', with "Lesson 1" again going up on the first Monday of the month.
