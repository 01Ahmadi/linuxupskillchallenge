# Day 6 - Editing with _vim_

## INTRO

Simple text files are at the heart of Linux, so editing these is a key sysadmin skill. There are a range of simple editors aimed at beginners such as: _nano_, _pico_, _joe_ or _jed_ . These all look horribly ugly, and as if they were written for DOS back in the 1980's - but are pretty easy to "just figure out".

The Real Sysadmin however, uses _vi_  - this is _not_ easy to "just figure out"!

It is however the editor that's always installed on any Unix or Linux system - and today you'll get started using it.

Bill Joy wrote _vi_ back in the mid 1970's - and even the "modern" descendant _vim_ that we'll concentrate on is over 20 years old, but despite their age, these remain the standard editors on command-line server boxes. Additionally, they have a loyal following among programmers, and even some writers.

Very often when you type _vi_, what the system actually starts is _vim_. To see if this is true of your system type:

     vi --version

## THE TWO THINGS YOU NEED TO KNOW

* There are two "modes" - with very different behaviours
* Little or nothing onscreen lets you know which mode you're currently in!
