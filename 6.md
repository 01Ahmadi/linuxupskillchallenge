#  Day 6 - Installing Apache

## INTRO

For the first day of the second week, you'll install a common application - the Apache2 web server - also known as *httpd* - the "Hyper Text Transport Protocol Daemon"!

If you’re a website professional then you might do things slightly differently, but our focus with this is not on Apache itself, or the website content, but to get a better understanding of:

* application installation
* configuration files
* services
* logs

## TASKS
* Refresh your list of available packages (apps) by: _sudo apt-get update_ - this takes a moment or two, but ensures that you'll be getting the latest versions. 
* Install Apache from the repository with a simple:  _sudo apt-get install apache2_
* Confirm that it’s running by browsing to _http://[your server DNS name or IP]_  - where you should see a confirmation page. 
* Apache is installed as a "service" - a program that starts automatically when the server starts and keeps running whether anyone is logged in or not. Try stopping it with the command: *sudo service apache2 stop* - check that the webpage goes dead - then re-start it with *sudo service apache2 start* check its status with: *sudo service apache2 status* - and see what other options are available with: *sudo service apache2*.
* As with the vast majority of Linux software, configuration is controlled by files under the _/etc_ directory - check the configuration files under */etc/apache2*  especially */etc/apache2/apache.conf* - you can use *less* to simply view them, or an editor like *nano* to view and edit as you wish
* The location of the default webpage is defined by the *DocumentRoot* parameter in the file */etc/apache2/sites-available/default*
* Use *nano* (or another editor like *vim* if you prefer) to edit the default page - normally at */var/www/index.html* - even if you've never seen HTML before you should see how to change the displayed body text, and then reload your the webpage in your browser to see the result.
* Notice the directory */etc/apache2/conf.d* - the settings in the files in this folder are merged in with those from */etc/apache2/apache2.conf* at load. This approach of lots of small specific config files is common. The ".d" extension has no special meaning to the operating system, but is a common convention to denote a directory.
* If you're familiar with configuring web servers, then go crazy, setup some virtual hosts, or add in some mods etc.
* As with the vast majority of Linux software, Apache keeps its logs under the */var/log* directory - look at the logs in */var/log/apache2* - in the *access.log* file you should be able to see your session from when you browsed to the test page. Notice that there's an overwhelming amount of detail - this is typical, and later you'll see we'll see how to filter out what we want. Notice the *error.log* file too - hopefully this one will be empty!

##Posting your progress
As usual, practice your text-editing skills, and allow us to judge your progress - but this time do it by editing */var/www/index.html* - so it should be visible on your new website. (It doesn’t have to be pretty!)

## Security
* As the sysadmin of this server, responsible for its security, you need to be aware that you've now increased the "attack surface" of your server. The logs may reveal access from a wide range of visiting search engines - and attackers - but that’s perfectly normal.
* If you run the commands: *sudo apt-get update*, then: *sudo apt-get upgrade*, and accept the suggested upgrades, then you'll be up to date, and secure enough for a test environment - but you should re-run this regularly.


## RESOURCES
* [HTTPD - Apache2 Web Server
](https://help.ubuntu.com/12.04/serverguide/httpd.html)
* [The Apache HTTP Server](http://docs.redhat.com/docs/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/6/html/Deployment_Guide/ch-Web_Servers.html#s1-The_Apache_HTTP_Server)

## EXTENSION

Read up on:

* [The traditional SYS V INIT system](https://www.linux.com/news/enterprise/systems-management/8116-an-introduction-to-services-runlevels-and-rcd-scripts)
* Find the Apache service script under */etc/init.d* and have a read - this is a "shell script"
* Check to see how it's started and stopped at various runlevels. (The command: *runlevel* will show you what runlevel you started from and are currently running at, and the contents of */etc/rc3.d* show what will be started or killed when you move to runlevel 3)
* Google for information on the shiny new init systems coming to Linux: *upstart* for Ubuntu and *systemd* for CentOS and others
