# DAY 0 - How 

## INTRO
First, you need a server. You can't really learn about administering a remote Linux server without having a one of your own - so we've st one up especially for you.

Through the magic of Linux and virtualisation, it's now possible to get a small Internet server setup almost instantly - and at very low cost. Technically, your new server is a VPS  ("Virtual Private Server") in an Amazon's AWS datacentre. However, there are many hundreds of hosting companies offering low cost VPS deals - and sites like http://lowendbox.com/ that compare them.

As well as a hosting provider, we also need to choose which "flavour" of Linux to install on the server - and we've gone with the latest LTS ("Long Term Support") version of Ubuntu Server. 
 

## Host name or IP and login details
You should by now have received an email with the name or IP address of "your" server; and the required login credentials. (Note that in Linux the login name is case-sensitive! - user "steve" isn *not* the same as "Steve")
