# Day 3 - Power trip!

## INTRO
You have been logging in as an ordinary user at your server, yet you're probably aware that "root" is the power user on a Linux system. This administrative or "superuser" account, is all powerful - and a typo in a command could potentially cripple your server. As a sysadmin you're typically working on systems that are both important and remote, so avoiding such mistakes is A Very Good Idea.  

On many production systems all sysadmins login as “root”, but it’s now common Best Practice to discourage or disallow login directly by "root" - and instead to give specified trusted users the permission to run root-only commands via the *sudo* command. 

This is the way that your server has been set-up, with your “ordinary” login given the ability to run any root-only command  - but only if you precede it with *sudo*, and re-confirm your identity with your password.

Note that you will be prompted for *your* password - this is to confirm your identity (i.e. that a co-worker hasn't jumped on your machine while you're getting a coffee). Generally you'll not be prompted for this if you use *sudo* again within the next 15 minutes.  

## YOUR TASKS TODAY:
* Use the links in the "Resources" section below to understand how *sudo* works
* Test running the *reboot* command, and then via *sudo* (ie *sudo reboot*)

Once you've reconnected back:
* Use the *uptime* command to confirm that your server did actually fully restart
* Test fully “becoming root” by the command *sudo -i*  (note the change to your prompt) 
* Type _exit_ or _logout_ to get back to your own normal “support” login.
