# Day 3 - Power trip!

## INTRO
You have been logging in as "support" at your server, yet you're probably aware that "root" is the power user on a Linux system. This administrative or "superuser" account, is all powerful - and it’s easy to mistakenly cripple your server. 

On many production systems all sysadmins login as “root”, but it’s now common Best Practice to discourage or disallow login directly by "root" - and instead to give specified trusted users the permission to run root-only commands via the *sudo* command. 

This is the way that your server has been set-up, with your “support” login given the ability to run any root-only command  - but only if you precede it with *sudo*, and re-confirm your identity with your password.

## YOUR TASKS TODAY:
* Understand how to tell whether you have superuser powers or not
* Test running the *reboot* command, and then via *sudo*(ie *sudo reboot*)
* Use the *uptime* command to confirm that your server did actually fully restart
